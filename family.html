    <div class="p"> I have one brother. His name is Nix and he has <a href="https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/autism-spectrum-disorders-asd/index.shtml" target="_blank"> autism</a>  which is hard to almost impossible for him to communicate to us. I love him even he stresses me out sometimes. My mother was a hotel manager back in Pensacola and owned two hotels of her own. However, since my brother came along, she decided to retire and be a home mother. My father is a construction manager who talks to the home owner and he calls the right people to fix or help work on a house. He also makes bleprints of the house and edits them. My dad remains in Huntsville as we stay in Jackson with our grandmother, my mother's mother. My cousins are in different places than here in Jackson. Some live in Florida, some live in Alaska, and some live in Alabama. <br> <center><img src="https://thumbs.dreamstime.com/b/basic-rgb-134997457.jpg" width="50%"></center></div>
