     <div class="p"> When I was growing up, I've always wanted to become a doctor like any typical kid would. I wanted to help people and get a lot of money. I was told to be a doctor, you would have a difficult time getting there. To this day, I still question it. I have vivid memories back then but I remembered when it was much more simpler then than it was now. I used to play on my Wii and sometimes went outside and played in the pool or watch TV. I grew up to be smart but had trouble focusing due to my ADHD, but now I'm on medication that can help out to focus and not get distracted as often. I was born in Pensacola, Florida. Pensacola is the place I miss the most because I have not been there in forever and most of my dad's family is there. But when I'm always there, I loved to spend time with my grandma and see my cousin. D.A.R was  a public school in Grant, Alabama. Me, my brother, and my cousins used to go there. Me and my brother went there for two years but my dad wanted to be closer to his job, so we moved up to Huntsville, where I went to Chaffee. Chaffee had some of my best friends. Kai was my favorite because we talked a lot about certain things we liked and we played Minecraft all the time after school and homework. A few years later, my parents split(not divorced) and went seperate ways. I was told to go with my mother and I did. I landed at JCS in the 5th grade. I was shy and didn't know what to say but ever since I've been there, I've warmed up to everyone.<br> <center><img src="https://www.naukrinama.com/stressbuster/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/shayari-11.jpg" width=50%></center> </div>
